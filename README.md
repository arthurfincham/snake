<h3>Description</h3>

I made this snake game using a tutorial found on educative.io.

Link is [here](https://www.educative.io/blog/javascript-snake-game-tutorial#food).

Imported a font called *Invasion2000* from [1001fonts.com](https://www.1001fonts.com/invasion2000-font.html) which looks great for a classic, retro game.
